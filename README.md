Problem statement No.41 – Power System Fault Detection and Classification 
The Challenge: 
Design a machine learning model to detect and classify different types of faults in a power 
distribution system. Using electrical measurement data (e.g., voltage and current 
phasors), the model should be able to distinguish between normal operating conditions 
and various fault conditions (such as line-to-ground, line-to-line, or three-phase faults). 
The objective is to enable rapid and accurate fault identification, which is crucial for 
maintaining power grid stability and reliability.
